 GIT :
  --> Git keeps snapshots of the entire state of project.
  --> Every check-in version of the overall code has a copy of each file in it.
  --> Git maintains log of all commits. 


----> Three areas of GIT repositories :
  1) Working Tree :
	Th Working Tree in Git is a directory (and its files and subdirectories) on your file system that is associated with a repository. 
	
  2) Staging Area :
	These files are also referred to as "untracked files."

  3) History :
	Git stores history as a graph of snapshots of the entire repository.
	

----> Git Branch commands :
  --> git branch :
	-> The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches.
	
  --> git branch <bramch-name> :
	-> This command creates new branch for the repository.

  --> git branch remove <branch-name> :
	-> This command removes perticular branch.


----> Connecting Local Repository with Remote Repository :
  --> To push the files from local repository to remote repository, personal access authentication is required.
  
  --> How to set personal access key? :
	-> Open github, goto settings->Authentication.
	-> In authentication goto "developer settings"->"personal access token"->"generate new token".
	-> Now, the token will be generated and this token is used everytime whenever the code is push from local to remote repository.
 	-> This token has expiry.


----> Git commands to deploy your local repository on github:
  1) git remote add origin "<url>" :
	-> This command set "origin" as a key for mentioned github repository.

  2) git push -u origin master : (Push a branch to remote repo)
	-> Create and checkout to a new branch from your current commit: git checkout -b [branchname]
           Then, push the new branch up to the remote: git push -u origin [branchname]

  --> After executing above commands, git will ask you your username and password.
  --> Password is the same personal access token generated before.
  --> After giving correct username and password, the local commits are pushed to the remote github repository.

  3) git pull "<url>" :
	-> This command pulls all files and folders from remote github repository to our local machines
	->The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge.

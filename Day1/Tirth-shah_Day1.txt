Git

Theory:
  Rich client program
    Rich client programs are those programs that require more high end hardware and utilises all of the available hardware to execute.

  Thin client program  
    Thin client program are those program that do not require much of a hardware to execute.

  Version control
    Version control basically means that the history of the changes in program is maintained. And if we want to get back to the previous version of the software       then we can co back easily.

  Need of git hub
    If the program is stored on anyones local machine and due to any problem the system gets corrupted of any other faliure occurs then the data is lost, and so we use git.
